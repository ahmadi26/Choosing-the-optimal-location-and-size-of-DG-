Abstract: Renewable energy sources can supply a clean and smart solution to the increased demands. Among the cases where 
the use of renewable energy-based units can be explainable, economic issues in the development of production, reduction of environmental 
pollution, high productivity of these resources in production, improvement of the quality of electric power demand, reducing network 
losses, improving voltage profiles, reducing the network congestion, and many more can be named. Taking benefit from the renewable 
energy-based distributed generation (DG) units depends on choosing the optimal location and size of these units. Thus, photovoltaic (PV) 
and wind turbine (WT) are taken in this research as renewable energy-based resources of DG. The teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) 
algorithm is applied in order to solve the optimal location and size problem of WT and PV resources in distribution systems and results are 
compared with those of bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. It can be claimed that TLBO 
reveals more convenient solutions than other optimization algorithms.
